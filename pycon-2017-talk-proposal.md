# PyCon 2017 Talk Proposal

## Title

Introduction to Functional Testing

## Description

Functional tests. What are they? How do they differ from unit and integration tests? Which tools should you use? The hardest part is getting set up - which is exactly what this talk will go through: Setting up a functional testing framework with Nightwatch.js to test a Flask App.

## Who and Why

### Who is this talk for?

1. Web Developers - since they need to know that the app works as expected
1. QA/Testers - especially those that are manually testing apps

### What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to have?

Those attending should have a basic understanding of unit and integration testing and are ready to add functional testing into the mix.

### What do you expect the audience to learn or do after watching the talk?

By the end of this talk, you will be able to...

1. Discuss the benefits of automating tests
1. Explain what functional tests are
1. Compare and contrast functional tests with integration and unit tests
