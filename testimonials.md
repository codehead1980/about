Real Python is an awesome resource for the budding developer. Not only will you learn Python, you will learn how to *use* it as you build practical and functional web-based applications that increase in complexity throughout the course. The series introduced me to the power of Flask, demystified Django, and got me thinking of development as craftsmanship. 

I floundered for a long time trying to teach myself. I slogged through dozens of incomplete online tutorials. I snoozed through hours of boring screencasts. I gave up on countless crufty books from big-time publishers. And then I found Real Python. The easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions break the big concepts down into bite-sized chunks written in plain English. The authors never forget their audience and are consistently thorough and detailed in their explanations. I'm up and running now, but I constantly refer to these books for guidance. 

Get Real Python and get your hands dirty quickly so you spend less time in the abstract and more time making real applications. You could waste weeks, maybe months, groping in the dark for this information on your own. Or you could buy the series and get started today. It's worth every penny. Are you still reading my testimonial? What are you waiting for? That app isn't going to build itself.

Honestly, throughout this whole process what I found was just me looking really hard for things that could maybe be added or improved, but this tutorial is amazing! You do a wonderful job of explaining and teaching Python in a way that people like me, a complete novice, could really grasp.The flow of the lessons works perfectly throughout. The exercises truly helped along the way and you feel very accomplished when you finish up the course. I think you have a gift for making Python seem more attainable to people outside the programming world. This is something I never thought I would be doing or learning and with a little push from you I am learning it and I can see that it will be nothing but beneficial to me in the future!

The Real Python series is a great resource for beginner and intermediate Python programmers. I found the first course to be a good introduction to Python programming. The second course focuses on web programming with various little recipes for web scraping and working with web APIs. The latter portion of the book talks about Python web frameworks, like web2py, flask and django. I recommend these courses for beginners in Python and for those interested in getting into Python's web frameworks!

I discovered Real Python a few weeks ago, and immediately bought it. Even though I only needed it for the web development part, I found the whole book easy to follow. Which is rare, as most tutorials are dense and boring, and it seems, written for the writer than anyone else. The authors' of Real Python, on the other hand, are firmly aware of their audience. I wish I would have found the course earlier - much earlier.

I love the book because at the end of each particular lesson there are real world and interesting challenges. I just built a savings estimator that actually reflects my savings account - pretty neat.

One aspect of the Real Python series that may not get as much attention as the content itself is the service offered by its creators.  Notice in the forums how personalized responses are given. This highlights how the courses have been crafted - for the user. In all the material it feels as though instruction is not broadcast to the masses, but instead shared in a way that is comfortable and almost personal. The creators of Real Python care that users are able to understand, learn, and practically apply the Python language.

What I found great about your courses compared to others is in how it explains things in the simplest way possible. A lot of courses, in any discipline really, require the learning of a lot of jargon when in fact what is being taught could be taught quickly and succinctly without too much of it. Your courses also do a very good job of keeping the examples interesting. I particularly found the web scraping tutorial to be great, I felt like I was doing some actual programming instead of toying around with it and just printing "Hello world".

As a practice of what you taught I started building simple scripts for people on my team to help them in their everyday duties. When my managers noticed that, I was offered a new position as a developer. I know there is heaps of things to learn and there will be huge challenges, but I finally started doing what I really came to like. Once again - MANY THANKS

Thanks! I got to read the first 3 chapters of the book the first time it was available and I was totally hooked. I've been trying to learn Python by myself and it is totally challenging and just like what the intro in your book stated, YES, it is hard to find a good book and YES by far your book is the best that I have used.

- Abby

Just wanted to say thanks! I’ve tried using another tutorial but it was very convoluted and difficult to understand – this is much more straightforward! I really liked it! The best part is the practical application. I had no idea Python was this much fun. I literally built a number of websites from ground up and am in the process of launching my first MVP. Best Kickstarter ever.
